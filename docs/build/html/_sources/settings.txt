settings
========

.. automodule:: roqba.static.settings
    :members:
    :undoc-members:

.. literalinclude:: ../../roqba/static/settings.py

settings can be overridden by creating a local file:
roqb/static/local_settings.py
settings in that file will prevail over settings in the versioned roqba/static/settings.py
